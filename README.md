# Cricket Ball Tracking and Decision Review System

## Abstract
The application and use of artificial intelligence have expanded greatly in recent years. Following this growing trend, this project focuses on accurately tracking and detecting cricket balls in static images. The primary goal is to develop an open-source and interactive cricket ball tracking system, utilizing pre-existing resources like YOLO and other state-of-the-art object detection systems. The ultimate aim is to provide an open-source counterpart to professional Decision Review Systems (DRS), such as Hawk-eye.

## Introduction
This project leverages artificial intelligence for accurate cricket ball detection and tracking in static images. It aims to be an open-source alternative to professional DRS systems used in cricket. By harnessing the power of YOLO and other advanced object detection systems, this project strives to provide a robust and accurate tracking system.

## Features
- Accurate detection and tracking of cricket balls
- Leverages state-of-the-art object detection models like YOLO v8
- Open-source, light-weight and easily extensible for research and development


## Usage
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PratikMaitra/COMS_575_Project.git

2. To train the models from scratch, use the scripts from the trainer_script folder.
3. To view the results use the Test image script.

## Results

The results including the graphs are provided in the 'stats' folder.

## License

This is a open source project which is intended to be shared and tested by every cricket enthusiast. Have fun !!!
