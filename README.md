# Cricket Ball Tracking and Detection System

## Abstract
The application and use of artificial intelligence have expanded greatly in recent years. Following this growing trend, this project focuses on accurately tracking and detecting cricket balls in static images. The primary goal is to develop an open-source and interactive cricket ball tracking system, utilizing pre-existing resources like YOLO and other state-of-the-art object detection systems. The ultimate aim is to provide an open-source counterpart to professional Decision Review Systems (DRS), such as Hawk-eye.
